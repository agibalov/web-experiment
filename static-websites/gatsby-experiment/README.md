# gatsby-experiment

A Gatsby hello world.

* `npm start` to start in development mode.
  * http://localhost:8000 for the website
  * http://localhost:8000/__graphql for GraphQL explorer
* `npm run-script build` to build. Results will appear under `/public`.
* `npm run-script clean` to delete all caches.

## Notes

* `npm run-script build` generates a bunch of files I don't understand: there are a few JS files and a `/public/page-data` directory.
